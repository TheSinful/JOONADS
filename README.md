## **‚ú® What's new in JooonAddons V2?**
______________________________________________
***üåê Global Changes:***

**Dungeons:**

- A lot of new features, amazing for starter, novice or even experienced dungeons players!

- Starred mob ESP (Extrasensory perception)
> This feature allows you to see the mobs that you need to kill to "clear" the room through walls and from afar! Amazing for those silly mobs that runs to all of the corners the map has to offer!

- Seecreter (GAME-CHANGING!)
> A brand new, previously only found in paid mods, feature. When this module is enabled and configured, it AUTOMATICALLY grabs secrets for you, even through walls. You don't even need to look at it, simply stand near a click-able secret and the module will grab it for you!
> This secret can VERY significantly speed up your dungeon clear, and once you get the hang of it, you'll ask yourself how you ever lived without it!

- Auto Bonzo Mask
> This feature is GREAT for Master Mode players! When enabled, this module AUTOMATICALLY equips your Bonzo mask near-immediately when you are under a certain amount of health! No more walking into Withermancer and immediately dying.

- Auto Phase 3/Phase 5 Ghost blocks
> Also amazing for Floor 7 and MasterM Mode Floor 7 players. This module automatically places ghost blocks which allows you to easily pre-device and go down to phase 5 of the Floor 7 fight.

- Better Stonk
> If your looking for a alternative over Seecreter, Better stonk is your go! When enabled, mining blocks with ANY pickaxe automatically creates ghost blocks. No more spending millions on a efficiency 10 pickaxe!

- Vertical Jerry Chine Gun
> AMAZING For Floor 7 Crystals! When enabled, you only go upwards when clicking with the jerry chine gun.

- Terminal Waypoints
> Great for those pesky floor 7 party finder parties that leaves Terminals unattended, when enabled the mod renders a beacon waypoint to all inactive Terminal, Levers and Devices.

- Blindness remover
> Removes the blindness overlay entirely, the one that you get when Necron Teleports, and Livid.

# **‚ùìSome Frequently asked questions and answers:**

- Q: Is there a video preview?
> A: Yes!, there is the latest preview showcasing the entirety of Jooon Addons, as well as 2 others that has similar functionality to JooonAddons, specifically the Melody video showcasing all songs.
[JooonAddons V2 (CLICK ME!)](https://youtu.be/SjTYCJpzyPE),
[JooonAddons V1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYqCntvSDas),
[The Dojo](https://youtu.be/FmI1B04Hnfs),
[Melody (Harp)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z75T1vFggbU)

- Q: Is this mod Safe to use?
> A: Yes! This mod is entirely safe to use as it follows Hypixel's guidelines and only does actions the exact same way a regular human would.

- Q: Is (Feature) safe to use on Hypixel?
> A: Every single feature in this mod has been hand crafted to strictly follow what the network rules allow and disallow, meaning no feature will ever get you banned. You have nothing to worry about when using the Mod, and if you have concerns, feel free to comment, I always try to reply :)

- Q: Can I use this on any computer/account/network?
> A: Yes! This mod is not license based as it is entirely free to use, so you can use this on any Windows, MacOS, Linux, Ethernet/WiFi and Minecraft account as you wish.

- Q: What ping is this for?
> A: Any ping! If you have low ping but are simply struggling with the dojo or the harp you can use this mod as well!

- Q: What's the maximum amount of points I can get in the Dojo?
> A: As much as you'd like! You control when the mod stops, so point gain can be infinite!

- Q: How does Seecreter work?
> A: Seecreter is a very special feature, which I spent a lot of time designing and perfecting along side my beta testers. Seecreter simply rotates your player to where the secret is in a humanly manner, creates a "Stonking" interaction, and clicks the secret, the same way a normal player would click a secret.

- Q: What about Starred Mob ESP?
> A: This module also simply uses a vanilla feature (That you can enable using F3+B), and applies it to certain mobs with a star in their nametag, if the nametag is out of render distance, the ESP is disabled, so it is completely vanilla!

- Q: Can I get black belt and the combat experience with this? And can I get the Tuning Fork/Melody's Hair accessory too?
> A: Yes! You can use this to safely get all 7000 points required for the black belt, you can also easily use this to get both the Melody's hair accessory and the Tuning Fork!

- Q: Do you plan to support later versions of Minecraft, like 1.20?
> A: Not currently, as the base of the mod is written in 1.8.9, moving all of the features while retaining functionality would be difficult but not impossible, stay tuned!

- Q: How do I apply for Beta/Alpha tests?
> A: Currently these roles are filled and I'm not taking any new applicants, thank you for your interest!
